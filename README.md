# Contemporary Issues In Data: The Data Capability Wall
In this document, I explore two articles discussing the contemporary issue of the data capability wall, a challenge faced by organizations in fully leveraging their data assets.  The first article highlights the role of technology and tools in this issue, while the second article focuses on the responsibilities of business leaders and IT professionals in overcoming the data capability wall.  

## Article 1: "Who’s to Blame for the Data Capability Wall?"
The first article of Cameron Benoit's [Who’s to Blame for the Data Capability Wall?](https://insidebigdata.com/2023/09/06/whos-to-blame-for-the-data-capability-wall/) addresses the data capability wall and its impact on organizations. It points out that while technology and specialized solutions have evolved, many companies still struggle to effectively activate their data for business purposes. The article emphasizes that both user error and the limitations of data tools contribute to this challenge. Organizations often invest in tools without thoroughly assessing whether they meet their specific data goals and requirements. Moreover, they may neglect to establish a solid structural foundation for their data infrastructure.

>"Firms may find their system fails to support a vital data cleansing method, can’t keep up with data schema changes, or lacks the scalability to run transformations at scale. Typically, however, challenges indicate one key problem: after a sizeable investment of time and resources, data structures have hit a capability wall." 

In response to this article, it's evident that the data capability wall is a complex issue that involves a combination of technology shortcomings and organizational decisions. To overcome this challenge, organizations should prioritize evaluating tools based on their capabilities and features, considering their unique needs, and ensuring that their data infrastructure is well-structured. By asking the right questions and taking a thoughtful approach to data management, businesses can better position themselves to scale their data capabilities effectively.

## Article 2: "Unraveling the Responsibility for Data Capability Wall"
The second article [Unraveling the Responsibility for Data Capability Wall](https://whd.news/2023/09/06/unraveling-the-responsibility-for-data-capability-wall/), by WHD News, delves into the reasons behind the data capability wall and the roles of business leaders and IT professionals in addressing this challenge. It acknowledges that the data capability wall arises from factors such as technical expertise, infrastructure, and funding constraints. Business leaders are recognized as key players in overcoming this hurdle by developing clear data strategies, securing funding, and fostering a data-centric culture. However, their lack of technical knowledge can sometimes impede progress.  
On the other hand, IT professionals possess the technical expertise required to tackle the data capability wall, but they may face challenges due to the absence of a clear strategic direction and sufficient resources. This article highlights the importance of bridging the knowledge gap between business leaders and IT professionals to effectively address the data capability wall.  
In response to this article, it's clear that addressing the data capability wall requires a collaborative effort between business leaders and IT professionals. Business leaders should invest in technical education and provide a clear strategic direction, while IT professionals must implement the right tools and ensure data integrity. By working together and prioritizing data as a strategic asset, organizations can overcome the data capability wall and unlock the full potential of their data assets.
